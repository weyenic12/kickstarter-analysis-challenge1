# Analyzing Theater Kickstarter Outcomes

## Overview of Project

- The purpose of this analysis is to find trends in the data. We analyzed the outcomes of theater kickstarters based on the launch date to find when they were the most successful and when they were least. We also analyzed the date on the number of successful, failed or canceled kickstarters based on the amount that their goal was when launched. By analyzing the data in this way, we were able to uncover trends.

## Analysis and Challenges

- The data we analyzed was the outcome of the theater kickstarters and matched that with month of the year that the kickstarter was launched. Our results are here: [Theater Outcomes by Launch Date](/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) line chart. We had no challenges analyzing this date but a possible challenge or difficulty would be making sure that the correct data is being analyzed. Making sure that the theater data was the only one being analyzed and that the data for the outcomes was accurate.

- The data we analyzed next was for the outcomes of the plays kickstarters and matched that with the amount of the goal that was desired at the launch of the kickstarter.. Our results are here: [Outcomes Based on Goals](/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) line chart. Again, we had no challenges other than making sure that the data was correct and that the right data was being analyzed.

## Results

- Some conclusions we can make on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart is that theater kickstarters are the most successful when launched in the summer months, specifically May-July. There is no correlation with kickstarters canceled and the launch date nor is there a strong correlation of kickstarters failed and launch date. The amount failed varies from 31-50 throughout the entire year.

- Some conclusions on the Outcomes Based on Goals are that there is a clear correlation with that amount of the goal and whether the play kickstarter was successful or not. For example, you can see that the kickstarters were much more successful when the goal was less, in this case anywhere from $1-$5,000. As the goal gets larger, the less likely it is to be reached and be successful. For example, the kickstarters with over $25,000 goal had a much more likely chance to fail.

- Some limitations of the dataset would be the amount analyzed. A larger sample size would give more accurate results and lead to a better conclusion. Also weeding out some of the data that is skewing the rest of the data. For example, campaigns for an extremely low amount of money or an unrealistically high amount. This can lead to a false conclusion of the data.

- Some other tables or graphs that could be created would be looking at the statistics of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. You can look that the mean, median, standard deviation, upper and lower quartiles and the IQR of the data to paint a better picture of the data. 
- Another graph that could be made would be all kickstarters and their outcomes based on the launch date time to see if it is just theater kickstarters that do better in the summer months or if it is all kickstarters that fair better off.
